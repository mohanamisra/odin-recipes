    <h1>Ice Cream</h1>
    <img src="images/icecream.jpg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For us, summer is not summer without all the frozen desserts. I make cake batter ice cream and cookie dough ice cream on repeat, too, but this rainbow version is always a favorite. I mean, who doesn’t love rainbows? My kids LOVE it but adults do, too! It brings out the kid in all of us.</p>
    <p>It’s impossible not to be happy when you make rainbow ice cream – you have to try it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir sugar, cream, and milk into a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until mix is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</li>
        <li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</li>
        <li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
